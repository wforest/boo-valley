# WARNING! Do not place your translation files here.

Any translation files placed here will be deleted when you update the theme.


## Translating the theme

If you have obtained the theme from **[WordPress.org themes repository](https://wordpress.org/themes/author/webmandesign/)**, please translate the theme by clicking the [Translate Boo Valley](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-themes/boo-valley) link in [theme page](https://wordpress.org/themes/boo-valley/) sidebar.

Otherwise follow these instructions:

1. Make a copy of the original `boo-valley.pot` file.
2. You need to rename the copied file now. The naming convention is based on [your language code locale](https://translate.wordpress.org/) and renaming the file extension to "po". So, the British English file would be named as `en_GB.po`, for example.
3. Use [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/) to translate the file and export (save) translation also in `mo` translation file format.
4. Upload translated `en_GB.mo` file into your WordPress language directory, such as `/wp-content/languages/themes/boo-valley/en_GB.mo`. Alternatively you can put translations in your child theme: `/wp-content/themes/your-child-theme/languages/en_GB.mo`.


## Contributing your translations back to the theme
